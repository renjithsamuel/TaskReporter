# Task Reporter

The main goal of this application is to provide users with an efficient and user-friendly way to manage tasks, collaborate with others, and generate reports and dashboards. It also offers a Google Sign-In feature for easy authentication. Task Reporter is a task management application built with ReactJS for the frontend and Node.js, MongoDB, and ExpressJS for the backend.

The application allows users to create and track multiple projects simultaneously, keeping track of their progress and syncing data dynamically when the device goes online after working offline. Inspired by the design of the Dribbble website and ColorHunt, Task Reporter also offers multiple themes and color palettes for users to choose from, enhancing the overall user experience.
